2pcf: two-point correlation function semi-tree code
---------------------------------------------------

The 2pcf code computes the two-point correlation function for points or fields
from all available pairs with the help of a semi-tree code (pairs are selected
using a tree, and pairs -- not leaf nodes -- are correlated).

The code is controlled via a configuration file, and examples are provided.

Compiler options can be customised using the `local.mk` include file for make.
Support for OpenMP parallelisation can be enabled there.
