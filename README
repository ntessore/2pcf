2pcf: fast exact two-point correlation functions
------------------------------------------------

The 2pcf code computes the two-point correlation function for point data and
real or complex spin-n random fields on the sphere or in the plane. It does so
using all available pairs of observations, without approximations at small or
large separations.

The code is controlled via a configuration file, and examples are provided.

Compiler options can be customised using the `local.mk` include file for make.
Support for OpenMP can be enabled there, or by building with `make OPENMP=1`.
