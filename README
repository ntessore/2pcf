2pcf: least squares two-point correlation functions
---------------------------------------------------

The 2pcf code computes a least squares estimate of the two-point correlation
function for real or complex spin-n random fields on the sphere or in the
plane, as well as real or complex spin-0 fields in 3D space. It does so using
all available pairs of observations, without approximations at small or large
separations.

The code is controlled via a configuration file. An example is provided.

Compiler options can be customised using the `local.mk` include file for make.
Support for OpenMP can be enabled there, or by building with `make OPENMP=1`.

The method of least squares two-point function estimation is described in a
short research note that can be found
