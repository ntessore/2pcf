2pcf: fast exact two-point correlation function code
----------------------------------------------------

The 2pcf code computes the two-point correlation function for point data and
real or complex spin-n random fields from all available pairs of observations
with the help of a semi-tree code (pairs are selected using a tree, but pairs
-- and not leaf nodes -- are correlated).

The code is controlled via a configuration file, and examples are provided.

Compiler options can be customised using the `local.mk` include file for make.
Support for OpenMP parallelisation can be enabled there.
